⛱️ An efficient Hook API and Xposed Module solution built in Kotlin.
<br/>

English | [简体中文](https://github.com/fankes/YukiHookAPI/blob/master/README-zh-CN.md)

## What's this

- This is an efficient Hook API rebuilt based on the Xposed API using Kotlin, and creates rich function extensions for the development of
  Xposed Modules
- The name is taken from ["ももくり" heroine Yuki Kurihara](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ss5016)
- Formerly the Innocent Xposed API used in [Development Learning Project](https://github.com/fankes/TMore), now renamed and open sourced

## Supports

- Basic ART dynamic method hook functions supported by Hook Framework
- Xposed Resources Hook

## Extensions

- Automatic Xposed Module Build (No need to create `assets/xposed_init` by yourself)
- [New XSharedPreferences](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed/wiki/New-XSharedPreferences#for-the-module) Supports
- DataChannel (Host ←→ Module)
- Simple and quick implementation of obfuscated bytecode reflection and finding functions
